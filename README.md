# HobbySite
The purpose of this website: 
 - A NodeJS application using ExpressJS, MongoDB / Mongoose, and HBS Templating.
1. Using Express handlebars to create hobby site web application.
2. Create shared header and footer.
3. Create controllers/views for my hobby views, login/logout, edit, and others.
4. Made a registration page and login page with also a Google account.
5. Made only private user can add, edit, delete.
6. Tried new feature that I choose; multer 

For CSS, I mainly used Bootstrap, plus I did my own simple css, sush as font, color scheme, and logos.

# For a feature of my choice is multer. 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer 
I installed it first, and made the form to upload the pictures from users in the recommendation page.
If you click 'add a new hobby' button, it take you to the page that allow you upload your images.
And once you upload you image, the images are stored in uploads folder and show your image imformation on the terminal on the VScode.
Then if you want to see that picture, go to the url 'localhost:3000/hobby/recommendation/nameOfPicture'.
If the picture name is cook.png, then url will be 'localhost:3000/hobby/recommendation/cook.png'
